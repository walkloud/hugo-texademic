## About

This theme started from [TeXify3](https://github.com/michaelneuper/hugo-texify3) at gitlog `4a9c4398666e797bb83963f68521adc6e3a9180f` from Nov 29, 2024.  Beyond the installation details provided in the TeXify3 docs, I've found I need to do
```
npm install autoprefixer
npm install postcss-import
```

I wanted to create a theme that is useful for my interests in creating a static site for an academic group and an individual.


## Installation

## Usage

### Collaboration Page

#### Members
Place portraits in your `assets/images` folder.  By storing images here, they are only copied to public if they are referenced by your content.  See this [hugo solution](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/re-markdown-style-images-with-full-path-when-baseurl-includes-subdirectory/55930) for advice on placing images.
