## About

This theme started from [TeXify3](https://github.com/michaelneuper/hugo-texify3) at gitlog `4a9c4398666e797bb83963f68521adc6e3a9180f` from Nov 29, 2024.  Beyond the installation details provided in the TeXify3 docs, I've found I need to do
```
npm install autoprefixer
npm install postcss-import
npm install giscus
```

I wanted to create a theme that is useful for my interests in creating a static site for an academic group and an individual.
