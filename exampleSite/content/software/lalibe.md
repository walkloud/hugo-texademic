LALIBE has been used for several LQCD calculations, including:

- A per-cent-level determination of the nucleon axial coupling from quantum chromodynamics, [Nature 558 (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0161-8) ([1805.12130](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12130))

- $F_K/F_\pi$ from Möbius Domain-Wall fermions solved on gradient-flowed HISQ ensembles

- Scale setting the Möbius domain wall fermion on gradient-flowed HISQ action using the omega baryon mass and the gradient-flow scales $t_0$ and $w_0$
​
- Detailed analysis of excited-state systematics in a lattice QCD calculation of $g_A$
