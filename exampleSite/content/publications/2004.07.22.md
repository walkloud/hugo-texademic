The masses of the spin-3/2 baryons are calculated to next-to-next-to-leading order in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory and partially quenched heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory. The calculation is performed for three light flavors in the isospin limit. These results are necessary for extrapolating QCD and partially quenched QCD lattice calculations of the decuplet baryon masses.
