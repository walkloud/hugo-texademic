The mass spectrum of the lowest lying octet baryons is calculated to next-to-next-to-leading order in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory and partially quenched heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory. We work in the isospin limit and treat the decuplet baryons as dynamical fields. These results are necessary for extrapolating QCD and partially quenched QCD lattice simulations of the octet baryon masses.
